./server -> All backend/server related files (i.e. API, authentication)
./studybuddy -. All frontend/react files

localhost:8080 -> Backend API 
localhost:3000 -> Frontend 

Both containers need to be online in order to send data back and forth through containers
Make sure you don't have anything else on port 8080 or 3000 when launching the app components

RUN APP VIA DOCKER:
    cd . (root directory)
    docker compose build && docker compose up
    Access localhost:8080 and localhost:3000 for webapp components

RUN APP LOCALLY:

To run frontend: 
    cd studybuddy
    npm i 
    npm start

To run backend:
    cd server
    npm i 
    npm start
